# Product Requirements Document: Media Library Modal System

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive Media Library modal system that provides a unified interface for browsing, selecting, and managing media across all admin forms. **The primary workflow is direct upload from computer within forms**, with the Media Library serving as a secondary browsing interface and management tool for previously uploaded content.

## ðŸ“‹ Updated Approach Summary

**ðŸŽ¯ Primary Focus**: Direct upload components that allow users to drag-and-drop or browse files directly within project/post/album forms, with immediate preview and alt text capture.

**ðŸŽ¯ Secondary Feature**: Media Library modal for selecting previously uploaded content when needed.

**ðŸŽ¯ Key Addition**: Alt text storage and editing capabilities for accessibility compliance and SEO.

## Goals

### Primary Goals (Direct Upload Workflow)
- **Enable direct file upload within forms** where content will be used (projects, posts, albums)
- **Provide immediate upload and preview** without requiring navigation to separate media management
- **Store comprehensive metadata** including alt text for accessibility and SEO
- **Support drag-and-drop and click-to-browse** for intuitive file selection

### Secondary Goals (Media Library Browser)
- Create a reusable media browser for **selecting previously uploaded content**
- Provide **media management interface** showing where files are referenced
- Enable **bulk operations** and **metadata editing** (especially alt text)
- Support **file organization** and **usage tracking**

### Technical Goals
- Maintain consistent UX across all media interactions
- Support different file type filtering based on context
- Integrate seamlessly with existing admin components

## Current State Analysis

- Media management page with grid/list views and search/filtering
- Modal base component (`Modal.svelte`)
- Complete admin UI component library (Button, Input, etc.)
- Media upload infrastructure with Cloudinary integration
- Pagination and search functionality

### ðŸŽ¯ What We Need

#### High Priority (Direct Upload Focus)
- **Enhanced upload components** with immediate preview and metadata capture
- **Alt text input fields** for accessibility compliance
- **Direct upload integration** in form components (ImagePicker, GalleryManager)
- **Metadata management** during upload process

#### Medium Priority (Media Library Browser)

- Add `usage_references` or similar tracking for where media is used

## Workflow Priorities

### ðŸ¥‡ Primary Workflow: Direct Upload in Forms
This is the **main workflow** that users will use 90% of the time:

1. **User creates content** (project, post, album)
2. **User uploads files directly** in the form where they'll be used
3. **Files are immediately processed** and previewed
4. **Alt text and metadata** are captured during upload
5. **Content is saved** with proper media references

**Key Components**:
- `ImageUploader` - Direct drag-and-drop/click upload with preview
- `GalleryUploader` - Multiple file upload with immediate gallery preview
- `MediaMetadataForm` - Alt text and description capture during upload

### ðŸ¥ˆ Secondary Workflow: Browse Existing Media
This workflow is for **reusing previously uploaded content**:

1. **User needs to select existing media** (rare case)
2. **User clicks "Browse Library"** (secondary button)
3. **Media Library Modal opens** showing all uploaded files
4. **User selects from existing content**
5. **Media references are updated**

**Key Components**:
- `MediaLibraryModal` - Browse and select existing media
- `MediaSelector` - Grid interface for selection
- `MediaManager` - Edit alt text and view usage
