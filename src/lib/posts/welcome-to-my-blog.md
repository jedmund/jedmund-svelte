After years of sharing my thoughts across various social platforms, I've decided to bring everything home. This blog will be a space for both quick notes and longer-form thoughts about design, development, and whatever else catches my interest.

## Why Now?

The internet feels different these days. Social media platforms come and go, APIs change, and our content gets scattered across dozens of services. I wanted a simple, permanent place for my writing that I control completely.

## What to Expect

You'll find a mix of content here:

- **Notes**: Quick thoughts, observations, and links I find interesting
- **Articles**: Deeper dives into topics I'm passionate about
- **Updates**: What I'm working on and thinking about

The design is intentionally minimal. No comments, no likes, no algorithmsâ€”just words on a page, the way blogs used to be.

## Technical Details

This blog is built with SvelteKit and uses markdown files for storage. It's fast, simple, and exactly what I need. No database, no CMS, just files in a folder.

Feel free to view source if you're curious about the implementation. Everything is open and straightforward.
